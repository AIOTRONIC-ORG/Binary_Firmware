fgor not depending
on main repository,
checkout required.

because that structure is made for separating
frmwr and pcb by submodels
instead of only separating bins
( binaries control ) hard to manage them

IN THIS REPO we can register
just  important releases 
and stable versions ...
to avoid look for that 
versions ins git log
of main dev repositories
( waste of time )
